# Matrix Helm Charts

## Overview

**Note:** I am actively testing each helm chart and plan to make `1.0.0` releases only after each have been tested / considered ready. For now, `ntfy`, `matrix-appservice-irc` and the two Python-based Mautrix bridges `mautrix-telegram` / `mautrix-googlechat` have been confirmed tested and working, hence `0.9.X` versions, but are due a `1.0.0` after further testing of different configurations / deployments.

A collection of helm charts to deploy services alongside Matrix, with example `values.yaml` files, initially focused on [ESS Community](https://github.com/element-hq/ess-helm) but should work with any Matrix deployment.
